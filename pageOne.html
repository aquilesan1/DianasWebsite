		<h2>
			<u>Kyoto, Japan</u>
		</h2>
		
		<img  class="img2" src="imgs/dimg4.jpg">
		
		<p>This might be one of Japan's most historic cities, 
		and it's definitely my personal favourite. It has so much history 
		and beauty. The jetlag ended up working in our favour, and we 
		were able to discover some of Kyoto's most famous land marks just 
		as the sun was rising around 5am. This meant lots of walking, and 
		even more memories were made before noon. All of Japan is very 
		friendly and polite, but I found that the kindest people over all 
		were in Kyoto.

		<h2>
			<u>Jupiter, Florida</u>
		</h2>
		
		<img class="img2" src="imgs/dimg6.jpg">
		
		<p>This is a beautiful sunny community where golf 
		carts and boats might be used more often than cars; in many 
		cases. The canal can be driven through and has little nooks of 
		sand banks where you can stop and lay in the middle of the 
		river. Florida has so much wildlife that blends into the cities; 
		I was lucky enough to swim with a manatee the day we were out 
		exploring Jupiter. This makes it one of my favourite 
		experiences as a trip.
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			<u>San Antonio, Texas</u>
		</h2>
		
		<img class="img2" src="imgs/dimg1.jpg">
		
		<p>This city is so full of life and culture. 
		The main shops and restaurants are nestled on the "riverwalk" 
		where you can see centuries of old architecture mixed with modern 
		day life. The mix of american and mexican heritage also play 
		a huge role in the city's flavours.
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			<u>Stanley, Hong Kong</u>
		</h2>
		
		<img class="img2" src="imgs/dimg3.jpg">
		
		<p>Visiting was a whirlwind experience with so much to 
		see and so many new things. This may be one of the world's busiest 
		and more expensive places but you can still find hidden gems of 
		nature amongst the city. There's so much to eat and do, this city 
		truly never sleeps. There are pockets of specialty shops and areas 
		for any kind of interest.
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			<u>Jinotepe, Nicaragua</u>
		</h2>
		
		<img class="img2" src="imgs/dimg5.jpg">
		
		<p>This is where my mom was born and raised. I 
		did also live there for a year as a baby. Nicaragua is a beautiful 
		country with so much biodiversity and blossoming nature. Jinotepe 
		in particular is a smaller city, where everyone knows each other 
		and neighbors stop by your door just to check in on their way to 
		the market. Every time I am visiting family, I feel like there are 
		always so many new things to see and do in this tropical escape.
